code defines an ImageAnalyzer class that performs the following steps:

API Configuration:
It retrieves an API key from environment variables (using the flutter_dotenv package).

Image Preparation:
It reads the provided image file as bytes and encodes it to Base64 format.

API Request:
The code sends a POST request to an image analysis API endpoint (originally the Google Vision API) with a JSON payload that contains the Base64-encoded image and a request for safe search detection.

Response Processing:
If the API call succeeds (HTTP status 200), the response is parsed to extract safe search annotations. The function checks if the image is flagged as inappropriate (e.g., if it has a 'LIKELY' or 'VERY_LIKELY' rating for adult or violent content).

Result:
The function returns false if inappropriate content is detected; otherwise, it returns true.
